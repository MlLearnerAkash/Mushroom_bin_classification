# Mushroom_bin_classification
Here, I have built a model using logistic regression to classify either the mushroom is poisonous or eatable.

**Description:**

1)we have processed and analysed the data

2)While processing,we have used label encoder to covert the string data type to neumeric data type .

3)Have shown the existance of multi-colinearity with different features.

4)Built different models to choose the best model.

5)Finally,we have compared the accuracy for different models and have choosen the Random Forest(with 100% accuracy),as shown below:
